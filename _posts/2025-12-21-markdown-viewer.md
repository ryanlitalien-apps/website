I've added a new app to the [Simple](/simple/) collection: **MarkdownViewer**.

It's a native macOS app for viewing Markdown files — think of it like Preview for images, but for `.md` files.

## Features

MarkdownViewer is built with SwiftUI and includes:

- **Full Markdown support** — headers, bold, italic, links, code blocks, lists, tables, images, strikethrough, task lists
- **Syntax highlighting** — fenced code blocks are properly highlighted
- **Multiple open methods** — File menu, double-click, or drag & drop
- **Copy options** — raw Markdown or formatted rich text
- **Light/dark mode** — follows your system theme

Universal binary that runs natively on both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs.
